# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection & Prediction – ML Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Plant Disease Detection System** using **Image Classification** techniques. It helps in identifying diseases in plant leaves by analyzing their visual patterns using a machine learning model. This tool can support farmers, agricultural experts, and researchers in taking preventive actions and ensuring better crop health.
